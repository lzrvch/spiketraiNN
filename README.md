# spiketraiNN
Lightweight Python library for spike train distance calculation.

This is a Python wrapper for a variety of spike train distance functors (plain C implementation from [https://github.com/rist-ro/spike-train-metrics](https://github.com/rist-ro/spike-train-metrics) as well as generic DTW distance for time series (plain C implementation from [https://github.com/lemire/lbimproved/blob/master/dtw.h](https://github.com/lemire/lbimproved/blob/master/dtw.h)).
